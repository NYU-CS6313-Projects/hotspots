# Traffic Collisions Hotspots

Awais Malik, Bartosz Bonczak, Radu Stancut

Our project goal is to provide the NYPD with enhanced cognition of traffic collision patterns in New York City by identifying collision hotspots and correlating them with specific enforcement-related causes.

All data used is openly available [here](http://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95).

A live demo can be found [here](http://rawgit.com/am5801/hotspots/master/code/hotspot.html).

A video describing our tool can be found [here](http://screencast.com/t/3Rgw9GtCEw).
